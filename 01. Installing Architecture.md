## 1. Overview
* IBM Cloud Private version 2.1.0 has the following features and functions:
    * A unified installer
    * ICP management console: manage, monitor, and troubleshoot application and cluster from a single, centralized, and secure management console
    * Private Docker image registry: provide a local registry service that functions in the same way as the cloud-based registry service, Docker Hub. This local registry has all same features as Docker Hub but also allows yo to restrict which users can view or pull images
    * A catalog of containerized software and services: the environment must be connected to the internet for you to access the charts for these packages
    * Isolated Tenant Networks: Calico allows improved performance and network isolation inside cluster
    * Robust monitoring and logging with ELK stack: ICP uses Elasticsearch, Logstash, Filebeat, and Heapster for collection, storage, and querying of logs and metrics, also install Kibana or Grafana to query the data in Elasticsearch DB
