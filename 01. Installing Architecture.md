- Overview ICP
- Architecture
- Components

**Reference**:


## 1. Overview
* IBM Cloud Private version 2.1.0 has the following features and functions:
    * A unified installer
    * ICP management console: manage, monitor, and troubleshoot application and cluster from a single, centralized, and secure management console
    * Private Docker image registry: provide a local registry service that functions in the same way as the cloud-based registry service, Docker Hub. This local registry has all same features as Docker Hub but also allows yo to restrict which users can view or pull images
    * A catalog of containerized software and services: the environment must be connected to the internet for you to access the charts for these packages
    * Isolated Tenant Networks: Calico allows improved performance and network isolation inside cluster
    * Robust monitoring and logging with ELK stack: ICP uses Elasticsearch, Logstash, Filebeat, and Heapster for collection, storage, and querying of logs and metrics, also install Kibana or Grafana to query the data in Elasticsearch DB
* Architecture
    * ICP cluster has 4 main classess of nodes: boot, master, worker, and proxy
    * Optionally specify a management node in cluster
    * Boot node: is used for running installation, configuration, node scaling and cluster updates
    * Master node: provides management services and controls the worker nodes in a cluster
    * Worker node: provides a containerized environment for running tasks
    * Proxy node: trnsmits external request to the services created inside cluster
    * Management node: hosts management services like monitoring, metering, and logging
