# ICP Architecture
Created by AnhNV Created Date: 28/11/2017

This document provides informaion about the following:

- Overview ICP
- Architecture
- Components

**Reference**:
- [Prometheus server][prometheus-server]
- [Calico][calico-release]

## 1. Overview
* IBM Cloud Private version 2.1.0 has the following features and functions:
    * A unified installer
    * ICP management console: manage, monitor, and troubleshoot application and cluster from a single, centralized, and secure management console
    * Private Docker image registry: provide a local registry service that functions in the same way as the cloud-based registry service, Docker Hub. This local registry has all same features as Docker Hub but also allows yo to restrict which users can view or pull images
    * A catalog of containerized software and services: the environment must be connected to the internet for you to access the charts for these packages
    * Isolated Tenant Networks: Calico allows improved performance and network isolation inside cluster
    * Robust monitoring and logging with ELK stack: ICP uses Elasticsearch, Logstash, Filebeat, and Heapster for collection, storage, and querying of logs and metrics, also install Kibana or Grafana to query the data in Elasticsearch DB
* Architecture
    * ICP cluster has 4 main classess of nodes: boot, master, worker, and proxy
    * Optionally specify a management node in cluster
    * Boot node: is used for running installation, configuration, node scaling and cluster updates
    * Master node: provides management services and controls the worker nodes in a cluster
    * Worker node: provides a containerized environment for running tasks
    * Proxy node: trnsmits external request to the services created inside cluster
    * Management node: hosts management services like monitoring, metering, and logging

## 2. Components
* ICP has two main components: Docker and Kubernetes
* Components:
    * Alert Manager: Handles alert by the Prometheus server, it takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as slack, email, PagerDuty

    * Ansible based installer and ops manager: deploys ICP on master and worker node
    * Authentication manager: provides an HTTP API for managing users
    * Calico/node: set calico network confifurations on each node
    * calicoctl: A client tool that runs as a Kubenetes job to set up overall calico configurations
    * calico/cni: set the network CNI plugins on each node
    * calico/kube-policy-controller: a controller center that sets the network policy in ICP cluster
    * Docker registry: (on each master node) private image registry that is used to store container image files, the docker distribution and registry version is API V2
    * Default backend: (single master node) 
    * Elasticsearch: (each master node) Stores the system and application logs and metrics, Elasticsearch also provides an advanced API that can be used for querying these logs and metrics
    * Filebeat: (runs on all master, worker, and proxy nodes) collects the logs for all system components, and user application containers that are running on each node
    * GlusterFS (run on selected worker nodes) : a storage file system
    * Heapster (single master node): connect to the kubelet that is running in each worker node and collects node and container metrics (CPU, memory, network usage)
    * Heketi (run as a pod on any worker node): CLI to manage GlusterFS
    * Helm (single master node): manage kubernetes charts
    * ICP management console (each master node): a web portal that is based on Open DC/OS GUI
    * IBM Cloudant Local (each master node): database that is used by OIDC
    * Image manager (each master node): manages images by providing extended features to the Docker registry. These features include authorization for push, pull, and remove operations. The image manager also provides authorization for cataloging of image libraries.
    * Indices-cleaner (single master or management node): cleans up Elasticsearch data
    * Logstash (single master or management node): allows Elasticsearch to filter container log
    * Kibana: UI providing easy access to data stored in Elasticsearch
    * Kubelet (run on all master, worker, and proxy nodes): Supervises the system components of the cluster
    * Kube-dns (single master node): Provides service discovery for Kubernetes applications.
    * Kubernetes apiserver (each master node): provides a REST API for validating and configuring data for Kubenetes objects (pods, service, and replication controllers)
    * Kubernetes control manager (each master node): maintains the shared state of the Kubernetes cluster
    * Kubernetes proxy (run on all master, worker, and proxy nodes): Provides service discovery for Kubernetes applications.
    * Kubernetes scheduler (each master node): assigns pods to worker nodes based on scheduling policy
    * Logstash (single master node): transforms and forwards the logs that are collected by File beat to Elasticsearch
    * mariaDB (each master node): database that is used by OIDC
    * OpenID Connect (OIDC) (each master node): Identity protocol over OAuth 2.0. Websphere Liberty profile is used as the OIDC provider. Liberty profile can be configured to integrate with an existing enterprise LDAP server.
    * Prometheus (single master node): collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true.
    * Rescheduler (each master node): used for pod management in a cluster. A rescheduler is an agent that proactively relocates running pods to optimize the layout of pods in a cluster (Referrence: [Rescheduler][rescheduler])
    * Router (each master node): Hosts the management console and acts as the reverse proxy for all system components API.
    * Service Catalog (each master node): implements the Open Service Broker API to provide service broker integration for ICP
    * UCarp (each master and proxy node): used to manage virtual IP (VIP) on the master node. This component helps to maintain high availability (HA) in the cluster. UCarp requires an HA master environment to start.
    * Unified router (single master node): Used to support backend functioning of the IBMÂ® Cloud Private management console.
    * Nginx Ingress controller (each proxy node): used to load balance NodePort Kubernetes services
