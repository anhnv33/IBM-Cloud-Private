## 1. Introduction to Microservices-Builder
### what is Microservice Builder?
Microservice Builder provides a turn-key approach with simple, step-by-step support that details how to create applications in a microservices framework. Microservice Builder greatly simplifies the software delivery pipeline that enables continuous delivery of containerized microservices, and provides developers with a frictionless application lifecycle, from development to production. With Microservice Builder, you can shorten the software delivery lifecycle for apps from weeks, to days, to minutes.

With Microservice Builder, developers can easily learn about the intricacies of microservice apps, quickly compose and build innovative services, and then rapidly deploy them to various stages by using a pre-integrated DevOps pipeline. Containerized apps that are created by using Microservice Builder can then be deployed to Kubernetes-orchestrated Docker environments either on-premises, or in the cloud. Microservice Builder provides users with end-to-end guidance that includes configuration, development, deployment, capacity planning, and monitoring to ensure a smooth microservices lifecycle from development to production. Microservice Builder includes programming model extensions to Java EE, defined by the MicroProfile.io collaboration, for writing Java-based microservices.

### why the Microservices revolution now?
Users benefit from the following microservices capabilities:
- Decomposing large applications into small pieces
- Providing loosely coupled, composable modules
- Enabling easily scalable development
- Improving fault isolation
- Developing and deploying each service independently
- Eliminating any long-term commitment to a technology

### What does Microservice Builder include?
Microservice Builder deliverables include the following functions:
- Binary files to support building and testing environments for microservice apps
- Low touch development to deployment experience with simplification of DevOps tasks
- Support for single sign-on (SSO) for security authentication and authorization
- A new landing page that includes end-to-end guidance to build Java microservices using extensions to Java EE defined by the MicroProfile.io collaboration
- An option to deploy with IBM Cloud Private, a Kubernetes-based Docker orchestration solution to simplify deployment on a single server or a pre-built Kubernetes cluster

## 2. Setup your local development environment
### Before you begin
Download Git.
- You need a Git client to work with code in source control.

### Installing the IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI
Microservice Builder helps you create, build, and test a WebSphere Liberty-based application. Throughout the stages, you might use your existing Java and Maven tools, or the IBM速 Cloud速 Developer Tools CLI.
- Install the IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI
- The version of the Kubernetes package manager, Helm, installed by IBM速 Cloud速 Developer Tools CLI might not be compatible with your IBM Cloud Private environment

### Running Kubernetes in your development environment
Optionally, if you want to test multiple services that are running on Kubernetes in your local development environment, you can install Minikube and add the Microservice Builder fabric.

## 3. Create and deploy a simple microservice 
#### Create a simple microservice
1. Run the bx dev create command to create a microservice. Select Java - MicroProfile/Java EE, Java - Spring Framework or Node.
2. The command, bx dev create, creates a directory in the current directory with the project name that you specify. Change to this directory and see the following elements:
- Application and build artifacts for the language and framework you selected.
- A Dockerfile to build the Docker image for the application
- A Helm chart that defines the Kubernetes configuration for deployment of the application
- A Jenkinsfile that is used to build the application in the Microservice Builder pipeline

### Build and run the code locally
1. Run ```bx dev build``` to perform a build of the application. This build takes place inside a Docker container so you do not need to have any additional tools or runtimes installed on your local system.
2. Enter bx dev run to build a Docker image with the built application and run it.

### Configuring deployment options
Your application deployment is performed by Helm. The deployment operation has many deployment options that are defined in the chart/[project]/values.yaml file. You can customize these values prior to deployment.
1. Create an overrides.yaml file in the chart directory to customize the values.
2. To customize a property, open the chart/[project]/values.yaml file and select the value to be customized.
3. Replicate that value in the chart/overrides.yaml file. Pay close attention to the indentation of the value and the hierarchy of the value location: both must match the overrides.yaml file.

### Deploy to Minikube

## 4. Programming model
The first part is the programming language and framework used by the microservice application code. Microservice Builder supports the following languages and frameworks:
- MicroProfile, which defines the APIs that you need to create microservices in Java. MicroProfile includes standard APIs from Java EE, such as JAX-RS for REST services, CDI for dependency injection, and JSON-P for handling JSON. The MicroProfile community develops and adds APIs. MicroProfile features that are part of WebSphere Application Server Liberty can be configured individually, or by including the microProfile-1.2 feature in the server.xml file.
- Spring Boot which simplifies the development of a Spring application in Java.
- Node which is designed for scalable network applications written in Javascript.
The second part of the programming model is the configuration resources that are provided by the Kubernetes container orchestrator and the fabric that is deployed on top of it. These resources include the ability to configure environment variables during container startup, provide a secure endpoint at the edge by using ingress, and consume a shared keystore and truststore for microservice instances.
### Configuring environment variables during container startup
You can define environment variables in a Kubernetes ConfigMap object, and then consume the ConfigMap object in the container deployment.
    1. Create a .yaml file in the chart/[app-name]/templates directory of the application to define a K8s ConfigMap object
```code
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: liberty-trace-config
data:
  maxfiles: "20"
  maxfilesize: "100"
  tracespec: '*=info'
```
    2. Modify the .yaml file that contains the K8s Deployment object to consume the Configmap. The **configMapKeyRef** fields needs to match the name in the ConfigMap object and the **key** need to match those in the data section of the Configmap
```code
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: liberty-sample
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: liberty-deployment
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: liberty
        env:
        - name: LIBERTY_TRACE_TRACESPECIFICATION
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: liberty-trace-config
              key: tracespec
        - name: LIBERTY_TRACE_MAXFILESIZE
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: liberty-trace-config
              key: maxfilesize
        - name: LIBERTY_TRACE_MAXFILES
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: liberty-trace-config
              key: maxfiles
        image: websphere-liberty:microProfile
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9080
```
    3. The env variables are bound to the container when it starts
    In a java microservice instance:
```code
System.getenv("LIBERTY_TRACE_TRACESPECIFICATION");
System.getenv("LIBERTY_TRACE_MAXFILESIZE");
System.getenv("LIBERTY_TRACE_MAXFILES");
```
    In Node Microservices:
```code
process.env.LIBERTY_TRACE_TRACESPECIFICATION
process.env.LIBERTY_TRACE_MAXFILESIZE
process.env.LIBERTY_TRACE_MAXFILES
```
