## 1. Introduction to Microservices-Builder
### what is Microservice Builder?
Microservice Builder provides a turn-key approach with simple, step-by-step support that details how to create applications in a microservices framework. Microservice Builder greatly simplifies the software delivery pipeline that enables continuous delivery of containerized microservices, and provides developers with a frictionless application lifecycle, from development to production. With Microservice Builder, you can shorten the software delivery lifecycle for apps from weeks, to days, to minutes.

With Microservice Builder, developers can easily learn about the intricacies of microservice apps, quickly compose and build innovative services, and then rapidly deploy them to various stages by using a pre-integrated DevOps pipeline. Containerized apps that are created by using Microservice Builder can then be deployed to Kubernetes-orchestrated Docker environments either on-premises, or in the cloud. Microservice Builder provides users with end-to-end guidance that includes configuration, development, deployment, capacity planning, and monitoring to ensure a smooth microservices lifecycle from development to production. Microservice Builder includes programming model extensions to Java EE, defined by the MicroProfile.io collaboration, for writing Java-based microservices.

### why the Microservices revolution now?
Users benefit from the following microservices capabilities:
- Decomposing large applications into small pieces
- Providing loosely coupled, composable modules
- Enabling easily scalable development
- Improving fault isolation
- Developing and deploying each service independently
- Eliminating any long-term commitment to a technology

### What does Microservice Builder include?
Microservice Builder deliverables include the following functions:
- Binary files to support building and testing environments for microservice apps
- Low touch development to deployment experience with simplification of DevOps tasks
- Support for single sign-on (SSO) for security authentication and authorization
- A new landing page that includes end-to-end guidance to build Java microservices using extensions to Java EE defined by the MicroProfile.io collaboration
- An option to deploy with IBM Cloud Private, a Kubernetes-based Docker orchestration solution to simplify deployment on a single server or a pre-built Kubernetes cluster

## 2. Setup your local development environment
### Before you begin
Download Git.
- You need a Git client to work with code in source control.

### Installing the IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI
Microservice Builder helps you create, build, and test a WebSphere Liberty-based application. Throughout the stages, you might use your existing Java and Maven tools, or the IBM速 Cloud速 Developer Tools CLI.
- Install the IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI
- The version of the Kubernetes package manager, Helm, installed by IBM速 Cloud速 Developer Tools CLI might not be compatible with your IBM Cloud Private environment

### Running Kubernetes in your development environment
Optionally, if you want to test multiple services that are running on Kubernetes in your local development environment, you can install Minikube and add the Microservice Builder fabric.
