## 1. Introduction to Microservices-Builder
### what is Microservice Builder?
Microservice Builder provides a turn-key approach with simple, step-by-step support that details how to create applications in a microservices framework. Microservice Builder greatly simplifies the software delivery pipeline that enables continuous delivery of containerized microservices, and provides developers with a frictionless application lifecycle, from development to production. With Microservice Builder, you can shorten the software delivery lifecycle for apps from weeks, to days, to minutes.
With Microservice Builder, developers can easily learn about the intricacies of microservice apps, quickly compose and build innovative services, and then rapidly deploy them to various stages by using a pre-integrated DevOps pipeline. Containerized apps that are created by using Microservice Builder can then be deployed to Kubernetes-orchestrated Docker environments either on-premises, or in the cloud. Microservice Builder provides users with end-to-end guidance that includes configuration, development, deployment, capacity planning, and monitoring to ensure a smooth microservices lifecycle from development to production. Microservice Builder includes programming model extensions to Java EE, defined by the MicroProfile.io collaboration, for writing Java-based microservices.
