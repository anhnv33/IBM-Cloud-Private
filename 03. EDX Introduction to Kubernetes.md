## Chapter 1. Container Orchestration
### Objectives
- Define the concept of **Container Orchestration**
- Explain the reasons for doing Container Orchestration
- Discuss different Container Orchestration options
- Discuss different Container Orchestration deployment options

### Containers?
Container are an application-centric way to deliver high-performing, scalable applications on the infrastructure of your choice

### Container Orchestration?
Container Orchestrators are the tools which group hosts together to form a cluster, help us fulfill the requirements below:
- Are fault-tolerant
- Can scale, and do this on-demand
- Use resources optimally
- Can discover other applications automatically, and comunicate with each other
- Are accessible from external world
- Can update/rollback without any downtime

There are many Container Orchestrators available, such as:
- Docker Swarm
- Kubernetes
- Mesos Marathon
- Amazon ECS
- Hashicorp Nomad

### Why use Container Orchestrators?
Container Orchestrators can:
- Bring multiple hosts together and make them part of a cluster
- Schedule containers to run on different hosts
- Help containers running on one host reach out to containers running on other hosts in the cluster
- Bind containers and storage
- Bind containers of similar type to a higher-level construct, like services
- Keep resource usage in-check, and optimize it when necessary
- Allow secure access to applications running inside containers

### Where to deploy Container Orchestrators?
- Most Container Orchestrators can be deployed on the infrastructure of our choice
- We can deploy them on bare-metal, VMs, on-premise, or on a cloud
